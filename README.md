# ThreeJS Earth Viewer with Divided Dodecahedron Wire

This project provides an interactive 3D viewer for Earth using Three.js. It allows users to toggle between different rendering modes and subdivisions for detailed exploration.

## Overview

The Three.js Earth Viewer offers a customizable interface for visualizing Earth in 3D. It leverages the power of Three.js to render a high-quality sphere representing the Earth's surface. Users can control various parameters such as texture, wireframe, and subdivision level.
